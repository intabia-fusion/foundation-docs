# Foundation Docs

Foundation Docs contains documentation for the Foundation platform. While Foundation Docs is currently in the early stages of development, our goal is for all concepts and features to be fully documented for our users.

Foundation is a fork of the [hcengineering/platform](https://github.com/hcengineering/platform) project, building upon its robust foundation to create an enhanced collaboration and project management solution.
