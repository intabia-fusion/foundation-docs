TraceX — built on top of the Foundation Platform — streamlines compliance for managing your product lifecycle and launching faster.

TraceX contains modules specifically designed for regulated industries such as medtech, biotech, automotive and aerospace. These modules include features for documentation management, electronic signature (21 CFR part 11, FDA), PDF export, and product management. All of the project management features available in Foundation are also included in TraceX, including task tracking, virtual office, chat, wiki docs and more.

Below are the special modules and features enabled by default TraceX, but these can also be enabled in any Foundation workspace. If you're a Foundation user interested in using any of the modules or features listed below, see how to configure them in our [workspace setup guide](/foundation-docs/ru/getting-started/workspace-setup).
