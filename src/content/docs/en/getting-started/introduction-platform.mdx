Foundation is an open source all-in-one project management platform offering an alternative to tools like Linear, Jira, Slack, Notion, and Motion.

Foundation is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/hcengineering/platform" target="_blank">hcengineering/platform</a> project, building upon its robust foundation to create an enhanced collaboration and project management solution.

By providing a powerful suite of features including workflow management, personal scheduling, collaborative editing and video conferencing, Foundation streamlines project management processes in a way that aligns seamlessly with the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world workflows.

Foundation Docs contains information about all of Foundation's main platform features. You can also read more about Foundation on my <a href="https://haiodo.github.io" target="_blank">blog</a>.

## Where we're headed

As we hone in on our goals for the future of the Foundation platform, we're focusing on creating a better system for process management system that actually reflects real, dynamic workflows. We're re-working the entire framework of the Foundation platform not only to support this goal but also to lay the foundation for our vision of a global Foundation that will be the only tool anyone will ever need to manage their work.

Our development is largely driven by user feedback, and we're committed to delivering an exceptional user experience while making room for fresh ideas and a different way of looking at the tools that have failed to fit the bill in the past.

Welcome to Foundation -- We're excited to grow with you.
