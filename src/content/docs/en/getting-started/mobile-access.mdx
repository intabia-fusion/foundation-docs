## Plans for the Foundation mobile app

We are still in the early stages of developing the Foundation mobile app and are not able to share a specific ETA for release at this time.

We're working on big infrastructure changes that will profoundly impact the way users interact with Foundation — particularly through our implementation of Global Foundation, where you can manage your communications and work under your global user account. This, in addition to the development of new designs, are important steps towards introducing our mobile app. 

Check out this preview of early design ideations for our mobile app (and other exciting concepts):

## Accessing Foundation and receiving notifications from your mobile device

Until we have a mobile app, you can access most of your Foundation workspace through the browser on a mobile device, and we're continuing to make improvements to the UI for mobile access.

There are currently two ways to receive Foundation notifications on your phone:
1. On iPhone, use Safari to add the Foundation web app to your phone desktop, then use webpush to receive notifications. Some views in the interface may not be optimized for mobile yet, but you can still access chat, inbox and several other modules.
2. Use the Telegram app to connect with our bot. By connecting your workspace to Telegram, you can receive notifications, send chat messages and reply to threads without ever needing to open Foundation. See our [Telegram integration guide](/foundation-docs/en/integrations/telegram) for more information.
